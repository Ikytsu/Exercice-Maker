# Exercice-Maker
The exercice maker saves everything you do, it's basically a old projet i have decided to finally publish (so normal if it's really a poor code, i am gonna to update this later). Running the file with python will create a .db to store data.

# Edit Mod:

## Multiple choice questionnaire:
Select a exerice and:
set in the bar title:
title, question 1, question 2 ect

the rest is for the answer, disable in the right or enable multiple answer.
and add arg to set what's correct.

## Non exact question:
Pretty much the same thing but for keywords you want in the answer.

## Exact question:
Set to false multiple answer or not is a must but it would change nothing.

# Test Mod:
Once you finished to create your beautiful exercice you can test your skills by closing and launching again the app and clicking on test.

# Libs:
you need to pip install customtkinter.
