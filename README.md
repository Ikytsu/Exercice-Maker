## Exercice-Maker
The exercice maker saves everything you do, it's basically a old projet i have decided to finally publish (so normal if it's really a poor code), i don't think i am gonna to update anytime this garbage i made like 1 year ago. Running the file with python will create a .db to store data.

## Multiple choice questionnaire:
Set in the bar title:
title, question 1, question 2 ect

the rest is for the answer, disable in the right or enable multiple answer
and add arg to set what's correct

## Non exact question:
Pretty much the same thing but for keywords

## Exact question:
set to false multiple answer or not is a must but it would change nothing.
